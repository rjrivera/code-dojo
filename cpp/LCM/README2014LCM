 ./How to Build (NOAH"S UPDATED FANCY CODE)



it's built now, so need to run like this:
 
dir$./KDFit3e n891 galaxiesXue.db n891xue.pdf





*****PARAMETERS (to revise bounds etc.) are in KDFit3e




REVISE TODO ABAJITO THIS LINE>..
------------

You only need to do this once. The galaxy DB file can
 be changed without rebuilding.


1. > cmake

2. 
> make



OLD GALAXY CODE: D. CHester-----

How to Run
----------

1. Prepare your galaxy DB file (see instructions below). The default name used is "galaxies.db";
 if you want to use a different filename, you'll need to specify it when you run the program (next step).


2. > ./ReadGalaxy [options]
   Available Options
   
 * -g [galaxy label] -- required -- specifies the galaxy used
   
 * -d [galaxy db file] -- optional [galaxies.db] -- specifies the galaxy DB file used
   
 * -c [constant] -- optional [1.0] -- scales the luminous matter distribution


How to Prepare a Galaxy DB File
-------------------------------
 - Galaxy DB files are text files that are read at run-time, so you do not need to rebuild after changing the DB file.
 - Each galaxy should be specified on a single line.
 - Blank lines are allowed.
 - Entire lines can be commented by starting the line with a pound symbol (#).
 - A galaxy line is made up of space-separated tokens; a token consists of a name and value separated by an equals sign; Name=Value.  There should be no spaces within a token, and quotation marks should be avoided.
 - Each galaxy must have a token specifying the label (e.g. Label=N230895)
 - The other tokens specify the filenames to be read/create files. The available token names are:
     Lum=[luminous matter file]
     Bulge=[bulge file]
     Disc=[disc file]
     Gas=[gas file]
     Data=[data file]
     DataError=[data error file]
     Out=[output file]
 - The Milky Way should have either a Lum token or a combination of Bulge, Disc, and Gas tokens.
 - All other galaxies should have either a Lum token or a combination of Bulge, Disc, and Gas tokens, plus all three of the Data, DataError, and Out tokens.
 - Duplicate token names are ignored. Only the first token with a given name will be used.

How to MAKE LUMmass pic:
1.use excel spread sheet MilkyWayLUMmassmodels.xlsc(or whatever extension is..) to make reduced rotation velocity 
from quadrature sum of gas and stars. 
2.make .txt file of radius and velocity, name MW_Lum_author.txt
3.edit LUM_MWmassmodels.c to include new milky way
4. in root, .x LUM_MWmassmodels.c
will run

TO MAKE NFW OR MOND FITS: 
need to hand edit the chi-square file to add a 7th column, 
which is the model predictions at the specified radius. 
Do this in an excel file, 
same the name of the updated chi-square file (append MODELedits.txt)
and run in root. Won't be a picture we want to save, 
so make sure has a different name than the one we use in the code.

Added 2.20.14 sofia
to run galaxies in terminal window, 
go to the correct directory,
 
$ make

$./ReadGalaxy -g galname -d galaxiesSpecify.db -c scalingValue


Once Chisquare file is made, 
$root
[].L KDfit2e.c
[]KDFit2("chisquareFilename.txt","output.eps")
